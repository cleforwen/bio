僕のホームページへようこそ。

I am Java & Web Developer with a 7 yrs experience using Core Java and J2EE Web technologies. I worked on a different domain(telecommunication, banking, e-commerce) before and experience both Software Development Lifecycle and Agile Methodology. I have an in-depth experience in using Spring frameworks, Selenium 1 & 2 for automated testing and Apache Maven for continuous integration.  My main strengths are adaptability, dependability and the determination to get a job done as proven by my varied work experiences. I try to learn something new from every experience because I believe there is always room for self-improvement both personally and professionally.  Looking forward working with you soon. Thank you.
